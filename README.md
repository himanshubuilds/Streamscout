## Overview
StreamScout is a smart OTT search agent designed to solve a modern headache: finding exactly where a movie or TV show is legally streaming in India. Instead of hopping between multiple apps, users can simply search for a title and instantly see which platform holds the rights.

## The Problem
With the fragmentation of streaming rights across platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Jio Hotstar and others, finding where to watch a specific show in India has become a chore. StreamScout centralizes this search, acting as a unified discovery layer for Indian OTT content.

## Features
- **Smart Search:** Handles both exact and fuzzy search matches for movies and TV series so users find what they want even with slight typos.
- **Granular TV Data:** Breaks down availability by specific seasons for television shows.
- **Glass Frame UI:** Features a custom-designed, responsive, and mobile-friendly "glassmorphism" interface built entirely within Streamlit for a sleek user experience.
- **Free & Fast:** Built using lightweight frameworks and APIs to deliver fast results without a paywall.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend & Deployment:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (with custom CSS for the Glass Frame UI)
- **Data Source:** [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for accurate, up-to-date movie and television streaming providers.
